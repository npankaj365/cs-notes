# Threat Modeling

Systematic approach to identifying, quantifying, and addressing security and privacy threats. Answers: what are we building, what can go wrong, and what are we doing about it?

## Process

1. **Define scope**: System boundaries, assets, data flows
2. **Enumerate threats**: Use frameworks (STRIDE, LINDDUN, attack trees)
3. **Assess risk**: Likelihood × impact, or DREAD scoring
4. **Prioritize mitigations**: Cost-benefit analysis
5. **Validate**: Red team, formal verification, or testing

## Key Questions

| Question | Output |
|----------|--------|
| What are we building? | DFD, system architecture |
| What can go wrong? | Threat list |
| What are we doing about it? | Mitigations |
| Did we do a good job? | Validation results |

## Subsections

- **Frameworks**: STRIDE, DREAD, attack trees, kill chains
- **Privacy Threats**: Pfitzmann-Hansen terminology, LINDDUN
- **Trust Models**: Adversary capabilities and assumptions
