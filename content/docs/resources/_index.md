    Learning Cryptography through real-world crypto exercises
   
> We've built a collection of exercises that demonstrate attacks on real-world crypto.
>
>    This is a different way to learn about crypto than taking a class or reading a book. We give you problems to solve. They're derived from weaknesses in real-world systems and modern cryptographic constructions. We give you enough info to learn about the underlying crypto concepts yourself. When you're finished, you'll not only have learned a good deal about how cryptosystems are built, but you'll also understand how they're attacked.
