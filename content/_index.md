# Pankaj's Notebook of CS Stuffs

## What is this about?
As a PhD student diving deeper and deeper into the area of my interests, I encounter words that I am familiar with, but not be able to explain right away if I had to. I note down such words as I am reading papers or documentations here and there in whatever note-taking tool I have at disposal, but I also wanted to keep a centralized repository of all my deeper explorations. This is my attempt at just that.


## What is it going to include?
At the moment of creation, I am thinking of mostly keeping the notes from my area of study and research, loosely Computer Science, more narrowly anything to do with Systems and Security.
